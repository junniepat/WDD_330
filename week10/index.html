    <ul>
        <h3>I don't have the finished product of the group code had to leave before it was finished</h3>
        <li><a href="./group/quakes.html">Group Project</a></li>
        <li><a href="form.html">Form Validation</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Is there a point where we are asking for to much information to be validated on a form?</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Could it be possible to cause problems with the server when were asking for a lot of variables
            in the form input to be validated?
        </li>
    </ol>   

    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <div>
        <p>You can set patterns, length, amount of inputs needed in the "input" element.</p>
        <p>Server side validation is important to protect your site for security reasons. It need to be used
            along side client side validation.</p>
        <p>You can update JSON data in a fetch request by updating the body using JSON stringify: "body:JSON.stringify(data)"</p>
        <p>To check if a fetch was a succes you need to check that the promise was resolved then use
            the "Response.ok"</p>
