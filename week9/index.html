    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The reading said to not use the window attribute when using globa variables, but I saw it
            alot in code examples. Is it commonly left out? Is it really ok to leave it out or is it 
            just programmer preference?

        <p>This week I wasn't able to meet with my group because of my work schedule. I communicated
