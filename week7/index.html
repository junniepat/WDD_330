    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the advantage of redefining a function?</li>
        <li>Does it cause a program to take to long to run when using the next() sequence?</li>
    </ol>   
    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <div>
        <p>The callback function is used to continue running the program while
            you are waiting for something to finish its process in the program.
            The Promise function gives you a future result of an asynchronous 
            operation, which is how JavaScript runs. It gives you one of two results,
            it is either "Resolved" or "Rejected". 
        </p>
        <p>I learned form the reading that when you use a function inside another function 
            you have access to the variables that are part of the outer funciton. This 
            could become very useful, it could help keep from reduplicating code.            
        </p>
        <p>Asynchornous is a valuable tool that is used to keep from having to refresh your 
            webpage when content is updated.
